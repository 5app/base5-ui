# PageTitleManager

Create accessible page title announcements when navigating between pages in a single-page React app (SPA).

-   Move focus to a visible or hidden main page header on page change
-   (Optionally) easily manage your site's document titles

Inspired by [this blog post by Hugo Giraudel](https://hugogiraudel.com/2020/01/15/accessible-title-in-a-single-page-react-application/#title-announcer).

## The problem

When browsing a traditional server-rendered website, following a link causes the page to reload with the content of the new page. Screenreaders take this as a signal to announce the title of the new page to the user.

In a SPA, this typically doesn't happen by default, as new content is displayed without a full page reload. Because of this, users of assistive technologies might miss out on the fact that a new page was loaded, or if they do, they'll still manually have to navigate to the main content of the page.

The `<PageTitleManager>` and `<PageTitle>` components help you mitigate both of these issues by moving the user's focus to the main `<h1>` heading element on the page – but only after an in-app navigation has taken place.

## Setup

To keep track of the navigation state of the app, you need to wrap your app with the `PageTitleManager` component and provide it with the `pathname` prop, which you'd typically get from your client-side routing library. The content of this prop has to be a string, but it doesn't need to be the literal `location.pathname` attribute – you can also pass any other primitive value that will change when a client-side navigation occurs.

```js
import {useLocation} from 'react-router';
import PageTitleManager from 'base5-ui/PageTitleManager';

function YourApp({children}) {
	const {pathname} = useLocation();

	return <PageTitleManager pathname={pathname}>{children}</PageTitleManager>;
}
```

Once your app has been wrapped in this way, use the `PageTitle` component to render the main headings of each of your pages:

```js
import {PageTitle} from 'base5-ui/PageTitleManager';

function HomePage() {
	return (
		<main>
			<PageTitle>Welcome to my accessible app!</PageTitle>
		</main>
	);
}
```

## Custom styling

If you're already using styled heading components, you can pass those to the `PageTitle` component using the `as` prop; or pass `PageTitle` to the `as` prop of your styled component – both approaches should work.

```jsx
<PageTitle as={MainHeading}>Welcome to my super accessible app!</PageTitle>
<MainHeading as={PageTitle}>Welcome to my super accessible app!</MainHeading>
```

You can also create a new styled component based on `PageTitle`. It will render an `h1` element by default.

```js
const MainHeading = styled(PageTitle)`
	/* Your heading styles */
`;
```

## Visually hiding the heading

If a page in your app doesn't have an obvious readable heading, you can still provide a title to screen reader users by using the `PageTitle` component with the `visuallyHidden` prop. This hides the heading from sighted users, while announcing & focusing it for users of assisitive technologies.

```jsx
<PageTitle visuallyHidden>Your Profile</PageTitle>
```

## Complex heading contents

In case your PageTitle contains children more complex than a simple string, a text-only representation of the title must be provided via the `text` prop:

```jsx
<PageTitle text="Welcome to my app!">
	Welcome to <b>my app!</b>
</PageTitle>
```

## Setting the document title

You can also use `PageTitleManager` component to easily update your site's document title, i.e. the title that's shown in the page's browser tab.

To do this, add the `syncDocumentTitle` prop to the `PageTitleManager` component:

```jsx
<PageTitleManager syncDocumentTitle pathname={pathname}>
	...
</PageTitleManager>
```

You can also define a "base page title" that will be added at the end of the document title. The code in the following example would change the title of your document to "Home - My Site Name"

```jsx
<PageTitleManager
	syncDocumentTitle
	baseTitle="My Site Name"
	pathname={pathname}
>
	<PageTitle>Home</PageTitle>
</PageTitleManager>
```

## `PageTitle` props

<Props isToggle of={PageTitle} />
