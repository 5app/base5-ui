# PopOver

PopOver is a low-level building block used to attach an element (the 'popover') to another element (the 'reference element').

It's a wrapper around `react-popper`.

<Playground>
	<PopOver
		isOpen
		content="I'm a popover. I'll try to always open in a direction that keeps me visible."
		placement="top-start"
	>
		{popover => <span ref={popover.ref}>I'm a reference element</span>}
	</PopOver>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={PopOver} />

# Using the Arrow Components

The Arrow component is a tooltip "arrow" that can be dropped into any container element and will inherit its styling.

It accepts a placement string formatted in the style of popper.js (i.e. `left`, `top-start`, `right-end`) and will position itself on the opposing side of its parent element. For this to work, the parent element needs to have a position other than 'static', e.g. 'relative', 'absolute', or 'fixed'.

Use the `size` prop to adjust the arrow's size (in pixels).

<Playground>
	<div
		style={{
			position: 'relative',
			padding: 8,
			backgroundColor: 'grey',
			color: 'white',
			border: '1px solid black',
			borderRadius: 4,
		}}
	>
		Hello, I'm a box with a pointy arrow.
		<Arrow placement="bottom-start" size={12} />
	</div>
</Playground>
