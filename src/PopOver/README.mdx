# PopOver

PopOver is a low-level building block used to attach an element (the 'popover') to another element (the 'reference element').

It's a wrapper around `react-popper`.

<Playground>
	<PopOver
		isOpen
		content="I'm a popover. I'll try to always open in a direction that keeps me visible."
		placement="top-start"
	>
		{popover => <span ref={popover.ref}>I'm a reference element</span>}
	</PopOver>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={PopOver} />
