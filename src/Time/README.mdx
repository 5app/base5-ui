# Time

`Time` is a helper component for providing time given a context. For example if something happened a few seconds ago, let's say it happened a "seconds ago", similarly if it happened today, provide the time "3pm" rather than the full date, and dont provide too much information, seconds aren't relevant when we're talking hours.

On hover over the full time is provided.

## Props
