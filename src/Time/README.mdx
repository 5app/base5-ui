# Time

`Time` is a helper component for providing a reading-friendly time relative to a given context.

For example, if something happened a few seconds ago, it would say "less than a minute ago". Similarly, if the provided timestamp was today, report the time as "3pm" rather than the full date. The idea is to provide not too much information. E.g., seconds aren't relevant when we're talking hours.

The component auto-updates to keep the time accurate without requiring a page refresh. It renders a simple html `<time>` element with a `title` attribute that ensures that the full time is provided as a browser tooltip when holding a mouse cursor over it.
