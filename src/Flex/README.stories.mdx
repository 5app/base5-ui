# Flex

```js
import Flex from 'base5-ui/Flex';
```

`Flex` is a container component for building simple flexbox-based layouts using the `Box` component. It's especially useful when you want to lay out a small number of components with irregular widths in a row, and on opposing sides.

If you don't need to align items to opposing sides, the `InlineList` component might be a better option, as `Flex` can't control the spacing between its children. Instead use style props to add margin or padding to nested `Box` components (see examples below).

The component is built on top of `Box` and supports all its props. The props `align`, `column`, and `wrap` are aliases for the `Box` props `alignItems`, `stackItems`, and `wrapItems`.

## Examples

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Example">
		<Flex align="top" width="100%">
			<Box grow shrink>
				I take up all the free space and push other Boxes to the side!
				ðŸ‘‰
			</Box>
			<Box ml="m">ðŸ‘€ I'm smol.</Box>
		</Flex>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Wrapping example">
		<Flex wrap align="top" width="100%">
			<Box grow shrink mr="m">
				Still taking up as much space as possible.
			</Box>
			<Box shrink>
				If there's no room for me I'll wrap onto a new line down below.
			</Box>
		</Flex>
	</Story>
</Canvas>
