# Flex

`Flex` is a container component for building simple layouts using CSS flexbox. It's especially useful when used with the `Box` component which provides controls for laying out the children.

## Examples

<Playground>
	<Flex align="top">
		<Box grow shrink>
			I take up all the free space and push other Boxes away! ðŸ‘‰
		</Box>
		<Box>ðŸ‘€ I'm smol.</Box>
	</Flex>

	<Flex wrap align="top" mt="m">
		<Box grow shrink>
			Still pushing all them Boxes!
		</Box>
		<Box>I'll go down ðŸ‘‡ if there's not enough space for me.</Box>
	</Flex>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={Flex} />
