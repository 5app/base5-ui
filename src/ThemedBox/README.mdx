# ThemedBox

`ThemedBox` is a combination of the primitives `ThemeSection` and `Box`. While the `ThemeSection` is responsible for defining which theme colours can be used inside of it, the `Box` component actually picks up these theme colours and renders an element that uses them in its `color` and `background-color` declarations.

All props other than `name` are passed on to the `Box` component, so this component is a great starting point for creating Card components.

## Examples

<Playground>
	<ThemedBox name="page" p="l">
		<ThemedBox name="card" borderRadius="small" boxShadow="soft" p="s">
			Hello
		</ThemedBox>
	</ThemedBox>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props isToggle of={ThemedBox} />
