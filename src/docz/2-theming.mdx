# Theming

Being able to adapt the colours of base5-UI's components is a big focus of the library.

This section is still a work in progress, we'll try to add documentation around our theme system as soon as possible.

## Global theme

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

import ThemeSection from 'base5-icons/ThemeSection';
import Button from 'base5-icons/Button';

import theme from 'base5-icons/theme';

function App() {
	return (
		<ThemeSection name="page" baseTheme={theme}>
			<Button>Hello world!</Button>
		</ThemeSection>
	);
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById('root');

ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

## Theme section (local themes)

Hoo ha
