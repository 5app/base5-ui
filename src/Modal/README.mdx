# Modal

React components and hooks for building accessible modals (dialogs).

## Features

-   Supports multiple (stacked) modals
-   Handles focus management:
    -   Contain keyboard focus inside of the topmost modal
    -   Return keyboard focus to the element that triggered the modal after it is closed
    -   Contain screen readers from navigating outside of the topmost modal
-   Close the topmost modal when the <kbd>Esc</kbd> key is pressed
-   Prevent scrolling "behind" the modal

## Demo

## How to use

### Prerequisites

Wrap your app with the `ModalManager` and `BodyScrollLock` components. `ModalManager` does not render an element to the DOM and can be as high up as you want. It keeps track of all the open modals and makes sure that focus is properly locked & restored.

`BodyScrollLock` renders a `div` by default and should wrap the main content of your app. The HTML elements of your modals need to be rendered outside of this container. (If you use base5-ui's Portal or the built-in Modal component, this will be the case by default.) You can customise the rendered element using the `as` prop as seen below.

```jsx
import {ModalManager, BodyScrollLock} from 'base5-ui/Modal';

function App() {
	return (
		<ModalManager>
			<BodyScrollLock as="main">
				{/* The rest of your app */}
			</BodyScrollLock>
		</ModalManager>
	);
}
```

#### BodyScrollLock styling requirements

The `BodyScrollLock` component prevents the page body from being scrolled when a modal is open. The method it uses is very robust and works even if your app has elements with a fixed position, like navigation bars.

One trade-off to make this work seamlessly is that we require the vertical scrollbar on your root element to be visible always (even if the page content isn't long enough to cause a scrollbar). Without the below CSS, opening a modal in your app may cause the page in the background to shift slightly as the scrollbar disappears.

```css
html {
	overflow-y: scroll;
}
```

(Btw: Having this CSS on your page may be a good idea anyway â€“ it ensures that centered elements don't jump around ever so slightly when navigating between long pages with a vertical scrollbar and short pages without one.)

### Rendering modals

Once the above preparations are done, you can either use the built-in `Modal` component (built on styled-components) to render your modals, or build your own using the `useModalManager` hook.

Keep in mind that you're responsible for opening & closing your modals. We recommend that you keep your modal display logic tied to a router location or React state, as shown below.

#### Modal component example

```jsx
import Modal from 'base5-ui/Modal';

function MyPage() {
	const [hasModal, setHasModal] = useState(false);

	function toggleModal() {
		setHasModal(prev => !prev);
	}

	return (
		<>
			<Button onClick={toggleModal}>Toggle Modal</Button>
			{hasModal && (
				<Modal
					name="my-modal"
					onRequestClose={toggleModal}
					aria-labelledby="heading-id"
				>
					<Card>
						<Heading id="heading-id">My first modal dialog</Heading>
						<p>This is a modal.</p>
						<Button onClick={toggleModal}>Got it.</Button>
					</Card>
				</Modal>
			)}
		</>
	);
}
```

#### Modal props

<Props of={Modal} />

#### Custom modal example

The `Modal` component is a wrapper around the `useModalManager` hook and the external dependency [FocusLock](https://github.com/theKashey/react-focus-lock). If you want to customise how your modals are rendered, you can easily do so by re-composing its elements in a different way. The example below is a slightly simplified version of the built-in `Modal` component that you can use as a guide.

Be sure to include the `role="dialog"` and `aria-modal="true"` attributes on your modal component, as well as `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Portal from 'base5-ui/Portal';
import CenterContent from 'base5-ui/CenterContent';
import {useModalManager} from 'base5-ui/Modal/ModalManager';
import FocusLock from 'react-focus-lock';

const ModalWrapper = /* Your custom modal wrapper styling. */
const Overlay = /* Your custom overlay styling. */

function Modal({children, name, onRequestClose, ...otherProps}) {
	/**
	 * useModalManager returns a ref that must be
	 * passed to the modal wrapper component, and
	 * an `isAtTop` flag that's true when this modal
	 * is at the top (when multiple modals are open).
	 */
	const {modalRef, isAtTop} = useModalManager({
		name,
		onRequestClose,
	});

	return (
		<Portal>
			<ModalWrapper
				ref={modalRef}
				id={name}
				{...otherProps}
				role="dialog"
				aria-modal="true"
			>
				<CenterContent fillParent>
					<FocusLock>
						{isAtTop && <Overlay onClick={onRequestClose} />}
						{children}
					</FocusLock>
				</CenterContent>
			</ModalWrapper>
		</Portal>
	);
}
```
