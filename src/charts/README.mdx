# Charts

base5-UI provides a few very simple charts to illustrate trends and metrics in your UI.

The chart's colours can be customised by providing a `color` name from either the theme's `colorBlock` or current `section` palette, or any valid CSS color.

Both charts will take up the full width of their container and their height can be set using the `height` prop.

The charts are generated using [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js).

## SimpleChart

Takes a `data` prop that must contain of a simple array of number values which will then be plotted out as a pretty graph.

<Playground>
	<SimpleChart data={[5, 3, 4, 2, 5, 2, 1]} height={125} color="links" />
	<br />
	<SimpleChart data={[2, 1, 9, 6, 6, 3, 7]} height={125} color="highlight" />
</Playground>

## SimpleGauge

Takes a single `value` prop that must be a Number value between `0` and `1` which will then be plotted out as a pretty (half of a) pie chart.

<Playground>
	<SimpleGauge value={0.3} height={200} />
	<br />
	<SimpleGauge value={0.8} height={150} color="positive" />
</Playground>
