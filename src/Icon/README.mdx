# Icon

An image says more than a thousand words. ;)

See the Icons Overview page for a list of all available icons.

## Using the Wrapper component

Using the `<Icon />` wrapper component allows you to dynamically display icons by their (kebab-cased, not CamelCased) name. Using the Icon component will bundle the whole base5 icon set with your app. See the next section if you only need a few icons from the set.

<Playground>
	<Icon name="disk" />
	<Icon name="plus" />
	<Icon name="search" />
</Playground>

## Using individual icons

If you don't want to bundle the whole icon set with your app, import the icons individually:

```js
import DiskIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Disk';
import PlusIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Plus';
import SearchIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Search';
```

and use them directly:

<Playground>
	<DiskIcon />
	<PlusIcon />
	<SearchIcon />
</Playground>

## Props

The following props are available on both the individual icon components as well as the `<Icon />` component:

### `scale`

Number. By default, icons are sized at `1em`, scaling along with their surrounding text. The `scale` prop lets you define a scaling factor to size the icon, i.e. a value of `2` will make the icon twice as large.

### `color`

String. By default, icons use the colour of their containing element (`currentcolor`). You can change this to any valid color value here.

### `spacingLeft` / `spacingRight`

String. Add some left or right margin to the icon. Accepts any valid CSS length value, a unit must be included.

### `vAlign`

Boolean. Nudge the icon up by a few pixels to visually align it with its surrounding text, see the next section for an example.

## Aligning icons with text

When placed next to or inside of text, square icons tend to sit a bit too low compared to the text's baseline. Use the Boolean `vAlign` prop to nudge the icon up by a few pixels to visually align it with its surrounding text.

<Playground>
	<PlusIcon /> Without vAlign
	<br />
	<br />
	<PlusIcon vAlign /> With vAlign
</Playground>
