# Icon

An image says more than a thousand words. See the [base5-icons repository](https://github.com/5app/base5-icons/tree/master/src/svg) for a list of all available icons.

## Using the Wrapper component

Using the `<Icon />` wrapper component allows you to dynamically display icons by their (kebab-cased, not CamelCased) name. Using the Icon component will bundle the whole base5 icon set with your app. See the next section if you only need a few icons from the set.

<Playground>
	<Icon name="android" />
	<Icon name="plus" />
</Playground>

## Using individual icons

If you don't want to bundle the whole icon set with your app, import the icons individually:

```js
import AndroidIcon from 'base5-icons/Android';
import PlusIcon from 'base5-icons/Plus';
```

and use them directly:

<Playground>
	<AndroidIcon />
	<PlusIcon />
</Playground>

## Aligning icons with text

When placed next to or inside of text, square icons tend to sit a bit too low compared to the text's baseline. Use the Boolean `vAlign` prop to nudge the icon up by a few pixels to visually align it with its surrounding text.

	<PlusIcon /> Without vAlign<br /><br />
	<PlusIcon vAlign /> With vAlign
