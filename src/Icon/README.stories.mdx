# Icon

```js
import Icon from 'base5-ui/Icon';
```

An image says more than a thousand words. ;) [View all available icons here](/src-icons-readme)

## Using the Icon component

Using the `<Icon />` component allows you to dynamically display icons by their (kebab-cased, not CamelCased) name. Using the Icon component will bundle the whole base5 icon set with your app. See the next section if you only need a few icons from the set.

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Icon">
		<Icon name="disk" />
		<Icon name="plus" />
		<Text as="p" size="xxl">
			<Icon name="search" />
			<Icon name="search" scale={0} />
		</Text>
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Using individual icons

If you don't want to bundle the whole icon set with your app, import the icons individually:

```js
import DiskIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Disk';
import PlusIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Plus';
import SearchIcon from 'base5-ui/icons/Search';
```

and use them directly:

<Canvas>
	<DiskIcon />
	<PlusIcon />
	<SearchIcon />
</Canvas>

## Aligning icons with text

When placed next to or inside of text, icons tend to sit a bit too low compared to the text's baseline. They also often look darker than text, even if they "technically" have the same colour. The props `vAlign` and `dimmed` exist to compensate for these issues. Use the Boolean `vAlign` prop to nudge the icon up by a few pixels to visually align it with its surrounding text. Use `dimmed` to make the icon slightly transparent to match the text's appearance.

<Canvas>
	<>
		<PlusIcon /> Without vAlign and undimmed
	</>
	<>
		<PlusIcon vAlign dimmed /> With vAlign and dimmed
	</>
</Canvas>

## Transforming icons

You can both rotate and flip icons.

<Canvas>
	<ArrowIcon rotate={90} />
	<ArrowIcon rotate={90} />
	<ArrowIcon rotate={-90} />
	<ArrowIcon rotate={-90} />
	<ArrowIcon />
	<ArrowIcon flip="x" />
	<ArrowIcon />
	<ArrowIcon flip="x" />
	<InfoIcon />
	<XIcon />
</Canvas>

## Props

The following props are available on both the individual icon components as well as the `<Icon />` component:

<ArgsTable of={Icon} />
