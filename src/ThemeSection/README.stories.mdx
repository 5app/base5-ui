# ThemeSection

```jsx
import ThemeSection from 'base5-ui/ThemeSection';
```

The `ThemeSection` component has two main functions:

-   When used at the top of the app, it provides your app with a global theme object via the `baseTheme` prop
-   When used throughout the app, it assigns "theme sections" from your global theme to all children of the component.

To assign a theme section, set the `name` prop to a valid key from `theme.sections`. Any components inside of a ThemeSection will then use the colours defined for this section, until overwritten by a more deeply nested ThemeSection.

You can also select a "color block" from the theme, as defined in `theme.globals.colorBlocks`. Color blocks are single colour values mapped to semantic names, e.g. `positive: 'green', negative: 'red'`. The mapped colour will be used as the background colour of the theme section, while the text and link colours will be automatically computed to be as contrasting/readable as possible.

## Examples

<Canvas>
	<Story name="ThemeSection" args={{name: 'card'}}>
		{props => (
			<ThemeSection {...props}>
				<Box background="background" color="text" p="s" m="m">
					This is a simple box picking up its parent ThemeSection's
					text and background colours.
				</Box>
			</ThemeSection>
		)}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

## Props

<ArgsTable story="ThemeSection" />
