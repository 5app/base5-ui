# BackButton

A component for handling backlinks for navigation in apps.

## The problem

Hard-coding back links in an app where pages may have different entry points can quickly lead to a bad user experience. Users expect a link or button labelled "Back" to take them back to the page they came from â€“ just like their browser's back button.

So, one might think, why not just trigger the browser's back button using `history.back`? We need back buttons to have a sensible fallback for when there's no browser history yet, for example after a link has been opened in a new window, or when a page was reached via a link in an email.

This is where this component comes in. Wrap your app with the `BackButtonProvider` component and pass it the current pathname. In react-router, you can get it from the `useLocation` hook:

```js
import {useLocation} from 'react-router';
import {BackButtonProvider} from 'base5-ui/BackButton';

function YourApp({children}) {
	const {pathname} = useLocation();

	return (
		<BackButtonProvider pathname={pathname}>{children}</BackButtonProvider>
	);
}
```

`BackButtonProvider` tracks whether the user has navigated in the app. It then provides this information to the `BackButton` component via context. `BackButton` then either renders a `<button>` element, or the fallback link specified by you.

For visual customisation, you can pass the component to render using the `baseComponent` prop. Please make sure that this component has support for changing the underlying rendered element using the `as` prop (this is the case for components built using styled-components by default).

## Examples

<Playground>
	<BackButtonProvider pathname="/current/url">
		<BackButton
			baseComponent={Button}
			as="a"
			href="/fallback-link"
			icon="arrow"
		>
			Back button
		</BackButton>
		<br />
		<br />
		<BackButton baseComponent={TextLink} as="a" href="/fallback-link">
			Backlink
		</BackButton>
	</BackButtonProvider>
</Playground>

## Props

<Props of={BackButton} />
