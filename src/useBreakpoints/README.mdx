# useBreakpoints

A hook that returns an object containing the state of the current theme's media query breakpoints.
This can be useful when you need to render different markup depending on the user's screen width.

## Example

```jsx
const {m, xl} = useBreakpoints();

console.log(m, xl); // e.g. true, false
```

The breakpoint states are resolved using "mobile-first" `min-width` queries, i.e. they are reported as matching (`true`) when the viewport width is **wider** than the breakpoint.

**Word of warning:** Due to its reliance on client-side JS, this hook is not compatible with server-side rendering.

## Features

-   Choose your own breakpoints and breakpoint names
-   Works without resize event listeners (It uses the `window.matchMedia` API)
-   Keeps track of Media Query state in a single place, minimising the number of Media Query change listeners on the page

## Setup

In order to use the `useBreakpoints` hook, wrap your React app with the `BreakpointsProvider` component and initialise it with a configuration object that contains the widths of your breakpoints.

```jsx
import {BreakpointsProvider} from 'base5-ui/useBreakpoints';
...
const myBreakpoints = {
	smol: '360px',
	medium: '480px',
	largo: '840px',
};

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<BreakpointsProvider breakpoints={myBreakpoints}>
			<App />
		</BreakpointsProvider>
	)
}
```

## Usage

Once your app has been set up as described above, the `useBreakpoints` hook is ready to be used.

```jsx
import useBreakpoints from 'base5-ui/useBreakpoints';

...

function Component() {
	const {smol, medium, largo} = useBreakpoints();

	return (
		<nav>
			{medium ? (
				<DesktopMenu />
			) : (
				<MobileMenu />
			)}
		</nav>
	)
}
```

**Tip:** Rename your breakpoints while destructuring for a more readable variable:

```jsx
const {medium: isDesktop} = useBreakpoints();
```

## Getting the current breakpoint

If you need to read the currently active breakpoint, you need to provide the hook with an array of the breakpoint names you're interested in, ordered from smallest to largest.

The hook will then return the name of the largest matching breakpoint under the `currentBreakpoint` key.

```jsx
	const {currentBreakpoint} = useBreakpoints(['smol', 'largo']);

	return (
		<p>
			The current breakpoint is {currentBreakpoint}!
		</p>
	)
}
```
