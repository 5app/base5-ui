# Theming

Making the look and feel of the 5App Hub customisable has been an important part of its design from its early days. We didn't just want our clients to be able to add their own logo and maybe select a main colour for their hub, but instead make it possible to change the hub's look enough to fit in with their brand as seamlessly as possible.

In development, this flexibility has to be balanced with maintainability. This article explains how theming works in base5-ui, and how it's different from traditional theming approaches.

## What we call theming

Technically, a base5-ui theme includes colours as well as global variables for spacing, font sizes, media query breakpoints, and more.

Not all of these can be customised by our clients – variables related to spacing, layout, and typography are "owned by us" and remain mostly static.

The variables we expose for client branding were chosen based on their visual impact:

-   Colours
-   Corner radiuses (of buttons, cards, text inputs)
-   Logos & background images

It's these variables we're mainly interested about for the purpose of this article.

## Why "traditional" theming doesn't work for multi-client branding

Theming is often implemented by directly defining colours for classes of UI elements. For example, a web site supporting a light and a dark mode might implement its themes like this:

```css
:root {
	--navbar-background: var(--dark-green);
	--navbar-links: var(--white);
	--about-page-background: var(--light-grey);
	--signup-button-color: var(--dark-green);
	--product-selection-color: var(--light-purple);
	/* ... and so forth ... */
}
```

This approach works great if the number of themes you're working with is a fixed, low number, as is the case for most websites. In this scenario, when you add something to your site that requires a new colour variable, you just add it to each theme individually.

However at 5App, each client can have their own branded 5App Hub, so the number of themes we're working with is practically ever-growing.

When we add a new feature or design element to our product, we can't go back to every existing client theme and add in new variables. After all, theme creation can't be automated well. Changes need to be manually checked by a designer to be not only readable and accessible, but also pleasing to the eye. So this approach would not be practical for us.

Additionally, base5-ui is based on components. When you move a button from one place to another on your website, it shouldn't "break" – it needs to stay readable and fit in with its surroundings in a way that makes sense: A primary action button will do a great job on a contrasting background, but loses its impact when placed on a background that matches the button's own colour:

<Canvas>
	<Flex>
		<Box width={1 / 2} p="s" align="center" background="shaded">
			<Button color="primary">Action button</Button>
		</Box>
		<Box width={1 / 2} p="s" align="center" background="links">
			<Button color="primary">Action button</Button>
		</Box>
	</Flex>
</Canvas>

## A different approach

How do we avoid these pitfalls, and keep releasing new features and UI widgets without having to re-visit existing client themes?

Here's a summary of our approach:

1. We limit the number of theme variables that each component can _"know about"_ to a minimum.
2. We re-define those few variables depending on their context inside our app. We call these contexts "Theme Sections".

### Limiting what a component "knows about"

This first point is crucial: All base5-ui components only have access to the following theme variables:

-   `text`: Text colour
-   `background`: Background colour
-   `links`: Colour for links and other interactive element
-   `highlight`: A colour used to highlight elements – e.g. selection or badges
-   `shade`: The colour used for 'shading' backgrounds (usually white or black)
-   `textDimStrength`: The opacity of dimmed or greyed-out text
-   `shadeStrength`: The opacity of shaded backgrounds
-   `lineStrength`: The opacity of lines and borders

When we design and implement new UI components, we make sure that they work given only these variables.

By itself, this approach would be very limiting. Most designers would want to use more than just a single background colour throughout an app or website! This is where **Theme Sections** help:

### Adding context via Theme Sections

You can think of a Theme Section as a name given to a set of the variables listed above. At 5App, we're using just five different Theme Sections: `page`, `navbar`, `card`, `invertedCard`, and `colorBlock`.

Each of these sections defines the same set of variables. This makes creating a new client brand a straight-forward process of choosing appropriate colours for each individual Theme Section. Once defined in this way, you can be sure that all components will look good in them. And when building new UI components, we can be sure they will look good in existing themes.

### Color Blocks

Theme Sections can't cover all requirements for colouring UI elements in a modern app UI. In the 5App Hub, we use colours and icons to differentiate between different file types, or traffic light colours to rate the strength of a user's password.

For these use cases we came up with "Color Blocks": Simple mappings between a name and a colour, e.g. `positive: 'green', negative: 'red', 'asset-video': 'yellow'`. These can be used by UI components to add splashes of colour where necessary, and can also be customised for clients when needed.

<Canvas>
	<Pill icon="asset-video">Video</Pill>
</Canvas>

When used with text or icons, the colour assigned to a Color Block is always used as a background colour, and a contrasting text colour (black or white) is calculated automatically. (Technically, Color Blocks are just Theme Sections, too, but should only be used for simple components due to the limited control they offer compared to regular Theme Sections.)

## How to use Theme Sections

To see an example of a Theme Section definition, check out the [default base5-ui theme in our GitHub repo](https://github.com/5app/base5-ui/blob/master/src/theme/sections.js). The themes we create for our clients look quite similar to this; you can find those in our (private) Github repo [themepark](https://github.com/5app/themepark/tree/master/src).

You make a theme available to an app using the <LinkTo kind="Components/ThemeSection">ThemeSection</LinkTo> component as shown below. Throughout the app, you can then use the same component with just the `name` prop to control what nested components should look like.

```jsx
import ThemeSection from 'base5-icons/ThemeSection';

// Design tokens: Spacing, font-sizes, colour blocks, etc
import globals from 'base5-icons/theme/globals';

// Theme Sections
import sections from 'base5-icons/theme/sections';

const baseTheme = {globals, sections};

function MyApp() {
	return (
		<ThemeSection name="page" baseTheme={baseTheme}>
			Hello world!
		</ThemeSection>
	);
}
```
