import Status from './';
import Button from '../Button';

# Status

Any changes to the textual content of this component are reported to users of screen readers. It's equivalent to a div with the following props:

```jsx
<div role="status" aria-live="polite" aria-relevant="additions text" />
```

For more control you can override each of these props.

## Examples

<Playground>
	{() => {
		const [showConfirmation, setShowConfirmation] = React.useState(false);
		return (
			<>
				<Button
					isActive={showConfirmation}
					onClick={() => setShowConfirmation(v => !v)}
				>
					Click me
				</Button>
				<Status>
					{showConfirmation &&
						'Congrats, you have clicked the button! This message will be read out by screen readers.'}
				</Status>
			</>
		);
	}}
</Playground>

## Usage note

Make sure that the `Status` component is always rendered – even when it's empty – before you update its contents. If the element is added alongside its content, screen readers will **not** announce it!

The example below would not work:

```jsx
{
	showConfirmation && <Status>This status will NOT BE announced :(</Status>;
}
```

## Props

<Props of={Status} />
