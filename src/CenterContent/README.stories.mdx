# CenterContent

```js
import CenterContent from 'base5-ui/CenterContent';
```

Use the `CenterContent` component to center arbitrarily sized content horizontally and vertically inside of its container.

## Usage notes

The component renders two wrapper `div`s and is meant to be used in large components with an unpredictable height (e.g. modal popups or headlines in a banner). Don't use it for centering an icon within a circle or text within a button.

Use the `height` prop to define a minimum height for the component. If the content is taller than the height specified, the component will grow accordingly.

Instead of defining a height, you can also use the `fillParent` prop which will make the component grow to match the width and height of its container. When using this approach, make sure the container has a position other than `static` (for example `relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed`), and is not set to `overflow: hidden` as that could lead to longer content being cut off.

## Examples

<Canvas>
	<Story name="Simple example" args={{height: 350}}>
		{props => (
			<Box background="shaded" mb="m">
				<CenterContent {...props}>
					<PodcastIcon vAlign /> Hello
				</CenterContent>
			</Box>
		)}
	</Story>
</Canvas>

<Canvas>
	<Story
		name="Overflow example"
		args={{fillParent: true, spacing: 's', contentWidth: 200}}
	>
		{props => (
			<Box
				position="relative"
				width={200}
				height={200}
				border="thin"
				overflow="auto"
				style={{resize: 'both'}}
			>
				<CenterContent {...props}>
					This is a container that centres its content, but if there's
					not enough space to fit it all, it can be scrolled to reveal
					all content, instead of cutting it off.
					<br />
					Note that you can resize the container to see how it behaves
					at different sizes.
				</CenterContent>
			</Box>
		)}
	</Story>
</Canvas>
