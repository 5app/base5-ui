# CenterContent

Use the `CenterContent` component to center arbitrarily sized content horizontally and vertically inside of its container.

## Usage notes

The component renders two wrapper `div`s and is meant to be used for large components with an unpredictable height (e.g. modal popups or headlines in a banner). Don't use it for centering an icon within a circle or text within a button.

Use the `height` prop to define a minimum height for the component. If the content is taller than the height specified, the component will grow accordingly.

Instead of defining a height, you can also use the `fillParent` prop which will make the component grow to match the width and height of its container. When using this, make sure the container has a position other than `static` (`relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed` all work), and is not set to `overflow: hidden` as that could lead to longer content being cut off.

## Examples

<Playground>
	<Box background="shaded" mb="m">
		<CenterContent height={350}>
			<PodcastIcon vAlign /> Hello
		</CenterContent>
	</Box>


    <Box
    	position="relative"
    	width={200}
    	height={200}
    	border="thin"
    	overflow="auto"
    >
    	<CenterContent fillParent spacing="s">
    		This text is centred in its little square container, but if it gets too looooo<br/>
    		ooooooooooooo<br/>
    		ooooooooooooo<br/>
    		oooooooooong,<br/>
    		it just makes it grow with no cut-off edges.
    	</CenterContent>
    </Box>

</Playground>
