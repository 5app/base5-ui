# CenterContent

Use the `CenterContent` component to center arbitrarily sized content horizontally and vertically inside of its container.

## Usage notes

The component renders two wrapper `div`s and is meant to be used for large components with an unpredictable height (e.g. modal popups or headlines in a banner). Don't use it for centering an icon within a circle or text within a button.

Use the `height` prop to define a minimum height for the component. If the content is taller than the height specified, the component will grow accordingly.

Instead of defining a height, you can also use the `fillParent` prop which will make the component grow to match the width and height of its container. When using this, make sure the container has a position other than `static` (`relative`, `absolute`, or `fixed` all work), and is not set to `overflow: hidden` as that could lead to longer content being cut off.

## Examples

<Playground>
	<CenterContent height={350}>
		Hello <PodcastIcon />
	</CenterContent>

    <div style={{
    	position: 'relative',
    	width: 200,
    	height: 200,
    	backgroundColor: 'aliceblue',
    	border: '1px solid grey',
    	overflow: 'auto',
    }}>
    	<CenterContent fillParent spacing="s">
    		I'm centred in my little square container, but if I get<br/>
    		too looooo<br/>
    		ooooooooooooo<br/>
    		ooooooooooooo<br/>
    		oooooooooong,<br/>
    		I just make it grow.
    	</CenterContent>
    </div>

</Playground>
