# Popover

A Popover is a an element that's positioned so that it appears right next to another element (the 'reference element'). It's a low-level building block used for building dropdown menus, tooltips, and similar UI patterns.

The Popover component included in base5-ui is a simple wrapper around the `usePopover` hook. To customise the look and feel of your Popover, this hook makes it easy to create your own.

<Playground>
	<Box p="l">
		<Popover
			isOpen
			content="I'm a popover. I'll always stick to my reference element!"
			placement="top-start"
		>
			{popover => <span ref={popover.ref}>I'm a reference element</span>}
		</Popover>
	</Box>
</Playground>

# Props

<Props of={Popover} />
