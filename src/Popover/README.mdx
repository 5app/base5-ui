# Popover

A Popover is a an element that's positioned so that it appears right next to another element (the 'reference element'). It's a low-level building block used for building dropdown menus, tooltips, and similar UI patterns.

The Popover component included in base5-ui is a simple wrapper around the `usePopover` hook and the `PopoverCard` component. You can easily customise the look and feel of your Popover by replacing `PopoverCard` with your own implementation and keeping the hook to control the placement.

<Playground>
	<Box p="l">
		<Popover
			isOpen
			content="I'm a popover. I'll always stick to my reference element!"
			placement="top-start"
			p="s"
			variant="inverted"
		>
			{popover => <span ref={popover.ref}>I'm a reference element</span>}
		</Popover>
	</Box>
</Playground>

# Props

<Props of={Popover} />
