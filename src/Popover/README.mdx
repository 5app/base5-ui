# Popover

A Popover is a an element that's positioned so that it appears right next to another element (the 'reference element'). It's a low-level building block used for building dropdown menus, tooltips, and similar UI patterns.

The Popover component included in base5-ui is a simple wrapper around the [usePopover](/src-use-popover-readme) hook and the [PopoverCard](/src-use-popover-card-readme) component. You can easily customise the look and feel of your Popover by replacing `PopoverCard` with your own implementation and keeping the hook to control the placement.

Also see the hook [usePopoverState](/src-use-popover-state-readme) for an easy way to control the open/closed state of a popover, and [Tooltip](/src-tooltip-readme) for a ready-made component combining the hook and this component.
