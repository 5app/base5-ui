# useBackLink

```jsx
import useBackLink, {BackLinkProvider} from 'base5-ui/useBackLink';
```

`useBackLink` is a hook that returns a link to the previous page that the user has visited (if available). It also makes it easy to avoid circular navigation issues.

## The problem

Hard-coding back links in an app where pages may have different entry points can quickly lead to a bad user experience. Users expect a link or button labelled "Back" to take them back to the page they came from, or to a parent page. Clicking "Back" only to be taken to an unexpected or irrelevant page can be frustrating.

It might be tempting to just mirror the browser's back button behaviour using `history.back` to create back buttons on your site. However, this comes with several downsides:

1. It doesn't work when there's no browser history, for example after opening a new browser window. If your user opened a link in an email to arrive on a page with a button wired up to `history.back`, that button would simply do nothing. Boo!

1. It can conflict with manual navigation. A user may navigate "back" on your site by clicking a regular link, which will be registered by the browser as "forward navigation". This means that a new history entry will be created even though the user has navigated backwards relative to your page's hierarchy or structure.

1. Circular navigation: While users expect their _browser_ to take them back exactly where they were when they click the browser's back button, they don't necessarily expect back links on your site to work the same way. A user is more likely to expect a back link on a web site to match the site's hierarchy instead. Imagine navigating from the homepage of a web shop to a category page. On the category page, you click on a product, then return to the category page. If that category page had a "Back" button, where would you expect it to take you? Back to the product you just viewed, or back to the homepage? I'd argue that most users would expect to be taken back to the homepage (i.e. higher up in the site hierarchy), yet `history.back` would simply take them back to the product.

    Of course the back link on the category page could be hard-coded to always point to the homepage, but this won't hold up if categories can be navigated to from various other pages in the shop.

Back links are a surprisingly hard problem to solve on web sites and apps! The base5-ui `useBackLink` hook and `BackLinkProvider` component were built to handle this sort of complexity in a maintainable way.

## Walkthrough and examples

To enable the most basic usage of the hook, you need to wrap your app with the `BackLinkProvider` component as shown below. Make sure that the provider isn't unmounted as users navigate your app, so it should be placed below your router provider (so you can access the current location), but above your routes.

```js
import {useLocation, Link} from 'react-router-dom';
import {BackLinkProvider} from 'base5-ui/useBackLink';

function YourApp({children}) {
	const {pathname} = useLocation();
	return (
		<BackLinkProvider location={pathname} track={[pathname]}>
			{children}
		</BackLinkProvider>
	);
}

function BackLink({children}) {
	const backLink = useBackLink();
	return <Link to={backLink}>{children}</Link>;
}
```

Pass the location object or the current path to the `location` prop of the `BackLinkProvider` component, and pass the same property to the `track` prop, making sure that it is wrapped in an array.

The `track` prop of the `BackLinkProvider` component works similarly to the dependency array of React's `useEffect` hook. Whenever any variable in the array changes, `BackLinkProvider` will create a new entry in its history. This means you don't have to rely solely on the pathname for tracking back link changes, but you can also include query parameters or other variables you want to track.

The example below shows how the two query parameters `modal` and `page` are now also taken into account for creating new entries in the history, even if `pathname` stays unchanged.

```js
const location = useLocation();
const {pathname, search} = location;
const {modal, page} = parseQuery(search);

return (
	<BackLinkProvider location={location} track={[pathname, modal, page]}>
		{children}
	</BackLinkProvider>
);
```

> Note: If you simply want to track all and any location changes without specifying individual parameters, you can pass the whole location object to the `track` array, too. In that case, also add the `getLocationId` prop that's used to turn the `track` array into a unique string. For react-router's location object, you could set it to `([location]) => location.key`.

Now that `BackLinkProvider` knows when to update its history, it'll keep track of the user's navigation in a linear fashion. It doesn't work exactly the same as the browser's history, though: To avoid the circular navigation issues mentioned earlier, our history doesn't allow duplicate entries. So as soon as the user navigates to a page that already exists in the history, the existing page will be made the new user location, and any later history entries will be discarded.

### Back link fallbacks

When there's no page in the history to navigate back to (for example because it's the first page the user has visited), you may still want to render a functioning back link. Pass a fallback option to the hook, and it will return this link whenever there's no history to draw from:

```js
const backLink = useBackLink({fallback: '/home'});
```

### Hierarchy-aware history

Sometimes, you may have a back link in the header of a page that has subpages, each with their own nested URL. And you may want that back link to always point to a previously visited _parent_ page, so that users don't have to click the back link once for each subpage they visited.

The `basePath` option let's you implement this. In the example below, `backLink` will never resolve to any URLs that start with `'/products'`.

```jsx
function ProductsPage() {
	const backLink = useBackLink({fallback: '/home', basePath: '/products'});

	return (
		<>
			<Link to={backLink}>Back</Link>
			<Link to="/products/22">Product A</Link>
			<Link to="/products/523">Product B</Link>
			<Link to="/products/234">Product C</Link>
		</>
	);
}
```

There's also an option for more complex cases that can't be solved by a static base path. `shouldSkipLocation` is a function that's called for any "back link candidate", and if you return `true` from it, that candidate will be skipped, and an earlier history entry (or the fallback) will be returned instead.

```jsx
const backLink = useBackLink({
	fallback: '/home',
	shouldSkipLocation: location => location.startsWith('/products'),
});
```

## Handling automatic redirects

If a user is automatically redirected from one URL to another, two entries will be created in the back link history. This is a problem: If the user navigates back to the first entry, the redirect will be re-triggered, and the user ends up back on the page they just tried to navigate away from!

Luckily, there's a way to tell `BackLinkProvider` to treat redirects as a single link: Make sure that the page you've redirected the user to knows that it's a "redirect target". You can do this by adding a query parameter like `&wasRedirected=true` to its URL, or by adding some React Router location state. Then you can pass that information to the `BackLinkProvider` using the `wasRedirected` prop, and your back links will work again.

Note that the location passed to `BackLinkProvider` **must not** include the 'wasRedirected' hint, as otherwise we'd get the same issue in reverse.

```js
<BackLinkProvider
	wasRedirected={location.state?.wasRedirected}
	location={{
		...location
		state: {
			...location.state,
			wasRedirected: undefined,
		}
	}}
	track={[pathname, modal, page]}
>
	{children}
</BackLinkProvider>
```
