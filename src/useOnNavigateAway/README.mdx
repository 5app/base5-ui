# useOnNavigateAway

This hook lets you run a callback whenever the user clicks, or moves focus anywhere outside of a specified element. This is useful to handle changes caused by in-page navigation, e.g. closing a dropdown menu when the user navigates outside of an element that contains both the menu and the menu's trigger.

## Parameters

-   `excludedElementRef` - A React ref (as obtained from `useRef` or `createRef`) to an element that should be excluded from triggering the `onNavigateAway` callback
-   `onNavigateAway` - Function that's called when the user leaves the excluded element
-   `isEnabled` - Set to false to disable the hook (defaults to `true`)

## Examples

```js
useOnNavigateAway(wrapperRef, closeMenu, isMenuOpen && searchValue === '');
```
