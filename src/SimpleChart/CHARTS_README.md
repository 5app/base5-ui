base5-UI provides a few very simple charts to illustrate trends and metrics in your UI.

The chart's colours can be customised by providing a `color` name from either the theme's `colorBlock` or current `section` palette, or any valid CSS color.

Both `SimpleChart` and `SimpleGauge` will take up the full width of their container and their height can be set using the `height` prop.

The charts are generated using the lightweight library [Chartist.js](http://gionkunz.github.io/chartist-js).
