# useHasMounted

```jsx
import useHasMounted from 'base5-ui/useHasMounted';
```

A simple hook that will return `true` only when the host component is rendered on the client. Causes an instant double-render, so it may be best to use a third-party hook like [useIsMounted](https://usehooks-typescript.com/react-hook/use-is-mounted) instead.
