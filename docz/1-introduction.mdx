# Introduction

Welcome to base5-UI, 5app's library of reusable React components. base5-UI's focus is on providing easy-to-use base & layout components for building highly themeable pages.

## Installation

base5-UI is built on styled-components, so if you're not using it already, install it along with base5-UI.

```
npm i base5-ui styled-components
```

## Running the component library

base5-UI comes with its own documentation tool & development playground powered by [docz](https://www.docz.site/). To check it out, clone this repo to your local machine, install all needed dependencies using `npm i` and then run the following command:

```
npm run docz:dev
```

The documentation environment will then be available at https://localhost:3000, letting you browse available components to inspect their API and see usage examples.

## Basic usage

Before you can use base5-UI's components, your app needs to be wrapped in a `<ThemeSection>` which is passed an object containing the theme of your app. All nested components will then have access to the theme.

A basic app setup for base5-UI looks like the below. For this example, we're importing the default base5-UI theme, but you'll probably want to create your own or modify it. A guide on theming will be provided soon.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

import ThemeSection from 'base5-icons/ThemeSection';
import Button from 'base5-icons/Button';

import theme from 'base5-icons/theme';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeSection name="page" baseTheme={theme}>
    	<Button>Hello world!</Button>
    </ThemeSection>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");

ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```
